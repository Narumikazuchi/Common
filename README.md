# Utility Library
This library originally contained all classes that I used in my projects more than once. I made them universal instead of being hardcoded for the project in question and added them to the library in order to reuse them whenever needed. With time the library grew and not all aspects were needed in every project. That's when I decided to split them into organized individual pieces and also publish them on github as well as nuget.org.

# Common
The common library hold those features, that I think are independed and can get used everywhere. While some features are strictly speaking no longer needed, like the EnumValidator<TEnum> class, I leave them in for my own convinience.
  
## Installation
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Narumikazuchi.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Narumikazuchi)  
The installation can be simply done via installing the nuget package or by downloading the latest release here from github and referencing it in your project.
